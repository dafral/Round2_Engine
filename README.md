# Round2_Engine

Engine developed from scratch for 3D Engines subject using C++ language. 


## Usage
A 3D engine that allows you to see 3D models and try different textures on them. 


## How to use it
In order to load a fbx file, drag and drop it on the engine window. You can do the same with textures. Remember that the only files supported by the engines are FBX files for the 3D models and DDS/PNG files for the textures.

You can find some example files inside the "3D Models" folder.
